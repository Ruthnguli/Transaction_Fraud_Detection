The file /fraud-detection-deployment/fraud-detection-deployment/app/model/Transaction_fraud_detection.pkl is a binary file that contains the saved model. Since this file is generated by the joblib library and is not meant to be manually edited or created as text, it should remain empty in terms of content here. 

However, to clarify, this file is intentionally left blank as it will be populated with the model data when you save it using joblib in your Python script.
